Hunters Herald Helper
Introduction
Hunters Herald Helper is a unique application designed to notify users about updates to a specific web page's calendar. This project was developed as my first ever paid programming job, marking a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. After about a year of learning and growing in the field, this application stands as a testament to the skills and knowledge I've acquired.

Project Overview
The core functionality of Hunters Herald Helper revolves around monitoring changes in a web page's calendar. Due to the dynamic nature of the website and the challenges posed by its suboptimal performance, traditional methods of change detection were not feasible. Instead, the application employs a creative solution: it uses Puppeteer to take screenshots of the calendar and then periodically checks for changes using Pixelmatch. If a change is detected, the app notifies the user via an email sent through Nodemailer.

Key Features
Automated Screenshot Capture: Utilizes Puppeteer to capture screenshots of the web page's calendar.
Change Detection: Employs Pixelmatch to compare images and detect changes in the calendar.
Notification System: Sends email notifications using Nodemailer when changes are detected.
Cloud Integration: Leverages Cloudinary for image storage and Firebase Firestore for database management.
Scheduled Checks: Uses Node-Cron to periodically check for updates at specified intervals.
Challenges and Solutions
Developing Hunters Herald Helper presented several unique challenges:

Dynamic Content Handling: The target website's dynamically generated content required a shift from traditional element monitoring to image-based change detection.
Performance Optimization: Addressing the slow loading times of the website involved implementing strategic waits to ensure accurate screenshot captures.
Adaptive Comparison: The varying sizes of the calendar due to different events posed a challenge for image comparison. Learning to handle errors thrown by Pixelmatch when image sizes differed was a crucial part of the development process.
Personal Reflection
This project was not only a technical challenge but also a significant personal achievement. Being my first paid programming project, it represents the culmination of a year's worth of learning and dedication to software development. The experience of bringing a creative solution to life and overcoming the various technical hurdles has been incredibly rewarding.

Conclusion
Hunters Herald Helper is more than just an application; it's a milestone in my development career. It showcases my ability to think creatively, solve complex problems, and learn from challenges. As I continue to grow and take on new projects, Hunters Herald Helper will remain a proud example of where my journey in software development began.
